Repository containing my dotfiles for my arch installation.

Additional information will be added to this README.md file as 
it is updated.

Currently the home directory has the following symbolic links
    ~/.zshrc        -> ~/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc
    ~/.zcompdump    -> ~/dotfiles/zsh/.zcompdump

Currently Hyprland needs to be started with the path to the 
config:
    Hyprland -c ~/dotfiles/hypr/hyprland.conf
